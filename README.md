# odin-recipes

This project is going to be used to practice the HTML skills I have learned so far. I will be creating a website containing some of my favourite recipes. There will be multiple web pages for each of the recipes. Each recipe will contain an image, an unordered list of ingredients, and an ordered list of instructions.

Recipes I plan to include:
 - Jamacian curried chicken
 - Scrambled eggs on toast (ala' Dawn)
 - Pizza (dough and toppings)

 I will start with these 3 then decide later if I want to include more.

 To begin with I will just use HTML to structure everything. Then later I will use CSS to make it look pretty :)
