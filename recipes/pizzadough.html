    <h2>Method</h2>
        <h3>Starter</h3>
        <p>
            To begin the process, we need make a starter 24 hours in adavnce. 
        </p>
        <!--Include why we need to do this in paragraph above-->
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Start with 300ml of water in a larger tupperware tub. Mix in 5g of 
                    dried yeast. Once mixed, add 5g of honey and mix again. Finally add 
                    300g of pizza flour and mix until everything is combined.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place lig on tubberware and leave at room temperature for 1 hours.
                    Then place in the fridge for 24 hours to allow the yeast 
                    to ferment.
                </li>
            </ol>
        <h3>Dough</h3>
        <p>
            Now your yeast has had time to ferment and grow up a bit. 
            Its time to make the dough.
        </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Add 700ml of water to a large mixing bowl and mix the starter in 
                    until the start has melted in the water.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once combined, add 675g of flour to the mixture and mix until all the 
                    flour is coated.
                </li>
                <li>
                    At this point add 40g of sea salt and mix thoroughly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Finally, add another 675g of flour and mix until everthing is combined.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now empty the mixture onto a clean surface top and begin kneading the 
                    dough. Simply push the dough in the centre with one hand and fold the 
                    dough back over its self and push again. Repeat this action for around 
                    5 minutes and the dough should form into a stick glutton ball.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once you are happy with the consistency of the dough. We need to leave 
                    it covered on our surface for 20 minutes. This will take it from a sticky 
                    texture to a more smooth, workable state.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now our dough is in a smooth workable state, we need to oil up our hands 
                    with olive oil and smooth a little over the top of the dough. Run your 
                    hands along the edge and lift it from the surface. As we lift the dough 
                    it will begin to sag and stretch. This is what we want to happen as we begin 
                    to create a spine for the dough. We want to fold the stretched edges under our dough.
                    Its very important we keep the top of the dough at the top as this becomes the 
                    spine and air can be trapped inside. Resulting in nice fluffy bases for our pizza.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After around 10 folds we should have a nice smooth top on our dough. Add some oil to 
                    the mixing bowl we used earlier, coating the whole surface. Keeping our spine at the 
                    top we want to drop our ball of dough into the mixing bowl and leave covered 
                    for 2 hours to proove. In colder spaces you probably want to leave for longer. Italy 
                    is warm, 2 hours is fine there. UK is cold so I usually leave for 3-4 hours, especially 
                    in the winter.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now our dough have prooved up a bit. Its time to cut it into balls and get them ready 
                    for cooking or storing. If you dont have a dough cutter... get one! it will make this 
                    bit so much easier!!!
                </li>
                <li>
                    I like a a lot of pizza so I usually cut my dough balls into 280-320g. Divide your dough 
                    into portions. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    With each portion you want to flip it over so the spine is on the work top and 
                    then pull the edges into the centre and work in a sort of star shape. This will 
                    trap air in the dough and help with the fluffyness. Next, flip it back over 
                    (spine side up). Cup it with your hands and gently drag it towards you to seal the 
                    folds in. Rotate the ball and do this 3-4 times to seal all around the base. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Do the previous step with every portion you've cut out and then you are ready to move on.
                </li>
                <h4>Storage</h4>
                <li>
                    To store the dough balls for a later occasion. Coat the dough balls in a thin layer
                    of olive oil. Take some sandwhich bags (not zip tie ones you lunatic) and put your 
                    hand inside to turn the bag into a glove. Grab the ball and turn the bag inside out 
                    around it keeping the spine at the bottom of the bag. This way when you turn the bag 
                    inside out again to get the ball out. Your spine will still be at the top.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Store in the freezer until you inevitably eat them all and have to make more dough.
                </li>
